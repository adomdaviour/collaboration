        <h1>Climate Change</h1>
        <h3>What is climate change?</h3>
        <p>World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens 
            every aspect of human life. <br>Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic 
            warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.
            <br>We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.</p>

        <h3>What will be the impacts of climate change?</h3>
        <p>If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The UK and Europe will be vulnerable to flooding caused by extreme rainfall</li>
            <li>Countries in the Middle East will experience extreme heatwaves and farmland could turn to desert</li>
            <li>Island nations in the Pacific region could disappear under rising seas</li>
            <li>Many African nations are likely to suffer droughts and food shortages</li>
            <li>Drought conditions are likely in the western US, while other areas will see more intense storms</li>
            <li>Australia is likely to suffer extremes of heat and drought</li>
        </ul>
